RCvA3c
======

RCvA3c is RhinoCommon implementation of vA3c idea. Library generates json format strings for three.js.
RCvA3c is based on GHvA3c, a Rhino Grasshopper plugin library.
Matas Ubarevicius only refactored the code to loose Grasshopper references and componential boilerplate.
RCvA3c thus can be used just by referencing RhinoCommon projects as utility library.
